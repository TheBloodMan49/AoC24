# Advent of Code 2024

This repository compiles my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024, written all in python.

I tried to avoid the use of external libraries, but check `requirements.txt` for anything to install before trying the scripts.

## Content

`X/solve_1.py` is the solution for the 1st part of day X, and `X/solve_2.py` is the second part.

The input is stored in `input.txt`, and if I used the test input provided in the instructions, it is in `input_test.txt`.

I hope you have as much fun doing the challenges as I did !
